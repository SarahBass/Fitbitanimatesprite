Animate sprite with Javascript in Fitbit Studio

In the frames files you are provided with sample frames 1-6 that I created using the free software Vectornator for Ipad.
Change the CSS size and coordinates of the images to fit your needs. I also provided a background.jpeg example. 

This simple animation uses 6 frames, but you could definitely add more frames. It is animated frame by frame.
